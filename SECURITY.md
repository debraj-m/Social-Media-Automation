# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices, considerations, and guidelines for the Social Media Automation project. Given the sensitive nature of social media credentials and API keys, proper security measures are critical for safe operation.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

### 1. Credential Management

#### Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
- Store all sensitive credentials in environment variables
- Use the provided `.env.example` as a template
- Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`

#### Required Secure Storage:
- `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` (LinkedIn OAuth)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenAI API access)
- `TWITTER_USERNAME`, `TWITTER_EMAIL`, `TWITTER_PASSWORD` (Twitter credentials)
- `QUORA_EMAIL`, `QUORA_PASSWORD` (Quora credentials)
- `MEDIUM_EMAIL`, `MEDIUM_PASSWORD` (Medium credentials)

### 2. Authentication Security

#### OAuth Implementation (LinkedIn)
- Uses secure OAuth 2.0 flow for LinkedIn authentication
- Tokens are stored in `env/linkedin_token.json`
- Implement token refresh mechanism for expired tokens
- Validate redirect URI to prevent authorization code interception

#### Password-Based Authentication
- **High Risk**: Twitter, Quora, and Medium use password-based authentication
- Consider migrating to OAuth/API keys where possible
- Implement secure password handling practices
- Use application-specific passwords when available

### 3. API Security

#### Rate Limiting
- Implement proper rate limiting to avoid API abuse
- Respect platform-specific rate limits:
  - LinkedIn: 500 requests per person per day
  - Twitter: Varies by endpoint
  - OpenAI: Based on your plan limits

#### Request Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper error handling to avoid credential leakage
- Validate all API responses before processing

### 4. Data Protection

#### Token Storage
- Store OAuth tokens securely with appropriate file permissions (600)
- Consider encrypting token files at rest
- Implement secure token renewal processes

#### Content Security
- Validate and sanitize all user-generated content
- Implement content filtering to prevent malicious posts
- Log all automation activities for audit purposes

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Set restrictive file permissions
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 env/linkedin_token.json

# Create secure directory structure
mkdir -p env
chmod 700 env
```

### 2. Credential Rotation

- Rotate API keys and passwords regularly (monthly recommended)
- Implement automated credential rotation where possible
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### 3. Network Security

- Use VPN or secure networks when running automation
- Implement IP whitelisting where supported by APIs
- Monitor for unusual network activity

### 4. Code Security

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Implement input validation for all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries if database interactions are added

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

- Log all API requests and responses (excluding sensitive data)
- Monitor for failed authentication attempts
- Set up alerts for unusual activity patterns
- Implement audit trails for all automation activities

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the project maintainer with details of the vulnerability
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for the vulnerability to be addressed before public disclosure

### What to Include in Your Report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information for follow-up

## Known Security Risks

### High Priority
- **Password Storage**: Plain text password storage for Twitter, Quora, and Medium
- **Token Security**: OAuth tokens stored in plain text files
- **Credential Exposure**: Risk of credential leakage through logs or error messages

### Medium Priority
- **Rate Limiting**: Potential for API abuse without proper rate limiting
- **Session Management**: No session timeout or token expiration handling
- **Content Validation**: Limited validation of generated content

### Low Priority
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Regular updates needed for Python packages
- **Network Security**: No built-in network security measures

## Recommended Security Enhancements

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement credential encryption at rest
2. Add proper error handling to prevent credential leakage
3. Implement rate limiting mechanisms
4. Add input validation for all user inputs

### Short-term Improvements
1. Migrate to OAuth/API keys for all platforms where possible
2. Implement secure token refresh mechanisms
3. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Create automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement multi-factor authentication
2. Add role-based access control
3. Create secure credential management service
4. Implement automated vulnerability scanning

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Ensure proper handling of user data if processing EU users
- **Platform ToS**: Comply with each platform's terms of service
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
- **Privacy**: Respect user privacy and consent requirements

## Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke all API keys and tokens
   - Change all passwords
   - Review logs for unauthorized access
   - Notify affected users if applicable

2. **Investigation**:
   - Preserve evidence for investigation
   - Document the incident timeline
   - Identify root cause and impact

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes for identified vulnerabilities
   - Restore services with new credentials
   - Update security measures to prevent recurrence
